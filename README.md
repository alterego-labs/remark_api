# RemarkApi

Remark App is very simple solution to share your notes, ideas, remarks and mood.

Actually it is devised for to try some very long list of technologies and techniques in the wild:

- nodejs/express
- electron
- react native
- react
- redux
- elixir + cowboy + websockets
- postgresql
- server side rendering
- docker (maybe?)

This repo contains code for API layer of Remark App which is written on Elixir.

This readme will be updated later.
