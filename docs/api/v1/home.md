The Remark API allows you to connect your applications (web, mobile, etc) to service of exchanging of small remarks. Actually it likes as Twitter, but this project has been started by _AlterEGO-Labs_ to learn some technologies and tricks such as:

- Elixir applications
- Node.js applications with webpack, react, ES6
- React native applications for making iOS applications
- Electron applications for making Mac OS native applications
- Deploy server side with Docker
- And the main goal: try to do server side rendering.
